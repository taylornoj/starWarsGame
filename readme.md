# Whack-A-Yoda!

This project is putting a Star Wars twist on the classic whack-a-mole game.

This game is built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  I got more practice with querySelector(), Math.floor() and Math.random(), setTimeout() and clearInterval().

I modified some visual features such as the countdown and Yoda counter.

As stretch, I built an add on that tracks, updates and stores high score.  Even if you close your browser, the next time you open the game, your high score will still be present.
